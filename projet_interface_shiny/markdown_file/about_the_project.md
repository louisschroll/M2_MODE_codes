### The project interface

This Rshinny application was created in the context of the [FACE](https://osur.univ-rennes.fr/ue-bee-m2-FACE) teaching unit, which is part of the [MODE master's program](https://osur.univ-rennes.fr/MODE). 


              
              
### Time to build the app

- **Create** the app: quick 1 hour

- **Complexify** the app: add images, make sliders prettier, add save buttons, choose graphs... : 4-5 hours and more

- **Build** the model: 2 hours

- Create **graphs** of the model: 1.5 hours

- Create a **network** representation: 4 hours (it was tough!)

- Write an **explanation** of the model: 1 hour

- Understand how to integrate **LaTeX**: 2 hours

- **Publish** online: 20-30 minutes (but more with bugs)

- Fix bugs: $10^{20}$ hours

=> Between 20 and 30 hours

### Perspective : developping the app further

##### The model

- **Complexify** exchanges between the population 

- **Spatialize**? Not the most relevant for seagulls

- **Age structure**

- add **disturbances**

##### The app

- Allow the user to **add real data** to compare reality / simulation

- Provide a choice of reproduction model (Exponential, Berton-Holt, ...)

- make a paying version

### Feedback on the course

 - A course on **shiny** would not be necessary
 
 - Rather, a course to have a well-organized project and clean code
 
 - Great to finish the semester with this more playful project
